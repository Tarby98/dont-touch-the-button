# Don't Touch The Button!

**Don't Touch The Button** is an interactive web project built using **React**, designed to demonstrate dynamic UI updates, conditional rendering, and state management in a fun and engaging way.

This project represents my **first experience using React**, and serves as a learning exercise in building interactive front-end applications with modern web technologies.

## 📘 Project Overview

The application playfully challenges users with a single instruction — *“Don’t press the button.”*  
Each interaction triggers changes to the interface, including new messages, background images, and eventually a custom 404-style ending screen.
Had to include some Portal references in there. 

Through this project, I explored:

- Managing component state with `useState`
- Updating UI elements dynamically in response to user interaction
- Using inline styles and responsive layouts
- Integrating React via CDN and Babel without a build process

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **React 18** (via CDN)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5** & **CSS3**
- **Google Fonts**
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user is presented with a single button and a warning not to press it.  
2. Each click updates the message and background dynamically using React state.  
3. The button moves position to make interaction more challenging.  
4. After multiple interactions, the game ends with a playful “404” message.

## 📈 Future Improvements

- Adding sound effects and animations  
- Include transitions for smoother button movement  
- Refactor into a React build setup (e.g. Vite)
